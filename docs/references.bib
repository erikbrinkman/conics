  abstract        = {The least-squares fitting minimizes the squares sum of error-of-fit in predefined measures. By the geometric fitting, the error distances are defined with the orthogonal, or shortest, distances from the given points to the geometric feature to be fitted. For the geometric fitting of circle/sphere/ellipse/hyperbola/parabola, simple and robust nonparametric algorithms are proposed. These are based on the coordinate description of the corresponding point on the geometric feature for the given point, where the connecting line of the two points is the shortest path from the given point to the geometric feature to be fitted. ?? 2001 Pattern Recognition Society.

  abstract = {For each finite set of points in the Euclidean plane, and for each type of conic section - elliptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic - The algorithm presented here determines all the algebraically best fitting conics of the selected type: the best ellipse, the best hyperbola, or the best parabola. The supporting theory expands on Golub, Hoffman, and Stewart's generalization of the Schmidt-Mirsky matrix approximation theorem, on Bookstein's and Pratt's methods to fit conics, and on Gander, Golub, and Strebel's method to fit ellipses. Because neither the set of ellipses nor the set of hyperbolae is closed, the algorithm and its supporting theory must accommodate their boundary, which consists of the parabolic conics. The corresponding optimization problem consists in minimizing a quadratic form with two quadratic constraints, which an orthogonal change of variables transforms into a least-squares problem with one quadratic constraint. Hence analogies with geodetic coordinates identify geometric causes of numerical instability. For each type of conic, the resulting best fitting conic remains invariant under Euclidean transformations. Applications include the theory and use of sundials in archaeology and astronomy. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {n this paper, we describe a novel camera calibration method to estimate the extrinsic parameters and the focal length of a camera by using only one single image of two coplanar circles with arbitrary radius. We consider that a method of simple operation to estimate the extrinsic parameters and the focal length of a camera is very important because in many vision based applications, the position, the pose and the zooming factor of a camera is adjusted frequently. An easy to use and convenient camera calibration method should have two characteristics: 1) the calibration object can be produced or prepared easily, and 2) the operation of a calibration job is simple and easy. Our new method satisfies this requirement, while most existing camera calibration methods do not because they need a specially designed calibration object, and require multi-view images. Because drawing beautiful circles with arbitrary radius is so easy that one can even draw it on the ground with only a rope and a stick, the calibration object used by our method can be prepared very easily. On the other hand, our method need only one image, and it allows that the centers of the circle and/or part of the circles to be occluded. Another useful feature of our method is that it can estimate the focal length as well as the extrinsic parameters of a camera simultaneously. This is because zoom lenses are used so widely, and the zooming factor is adjusted as frequently as the camera setting, the estimation of the focal length is almost a must whenever the camera setting is changed. The extensive experiments over simulated images and real images demonstrate the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract = {A novel ellipse fitting method which is selective for digital and noisy elliptic curves is proposed in this paper. The method aims at fitting an ellipse only when the data points are highly likely belong to an ellipse. This is achieved using the geometric distances of the ellipse from the data points. The proposed method models the non-linear problem of ellipse fitting as a combination of two operators, with one being linear, numerically stable, and easily invertible, while the other being non-linear but unique and easily invertible operator. As a consequence, the proposed ellipse fitting method has several salient properties like unconstrained, stable, non-iterative, and computationally inexpensive. The efficacy of the method is compared against six contemporary and recent algorithms based on the least squares formulation using five experiments of diverse practical challenges, like digitization, incomplete ellipses, and Gaussian noise (up to 30{\%}). Three of the experiments comprise of a total of 44,400 ellipses (positive test data) while the other two are tested on 320,000 non-elliptic conics (negative test data). The results show that the proposed method is quite selective to elliptic shapes only and provides accurate fitting results, indicating potential application in medical, robotics, object detection, and other image processing industrial applications.},
